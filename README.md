### Notes
* This is a clone of a game I saw someone demo at a training event.
* There was a significant problem with the version they made, so I decided to recreate it. I fixed the issue.


To use:
* click the squares to change the colors
* to reset, just reload the site
* when clicked, a white square will cycle through 5 colors and not return to white as it is now "in play"
* it is meant to be a tool that keeps track of what "teams" have "won" which squares
* this is meant to be a flexible game where you make up the rules. It is the game board that keeps track of the game state.
